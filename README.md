# Galaxy Generator

The goal is for it to be scientifically "believable", while trying to remain as scientifically accurate as possible/where possible, without make any simulations. It is based on observational data, extrapolations from our own solar system and a fair bit of maths and guesswork/personal opinions.

You can see a working example here:

- [Galaxy Generator (API)](https://galaxy-generator.oogabooga.dev)
- [Galaxy Viewer](https://galaxy-viewer.oogabooga.dev)


## Outstanding

Asteroid belts and moons have not been implemented, yet.


## Development 

I have created a simple make file which gives you quick access to a couple of commands, run `make` to see the list.

The generator code can be found in `src/pkg/galaxy/`.


## Sources & Acknowledgements 

I only started noting down sources towards the end of the project, I tried to backtrack as much as possible but I know I missed quite a few - sorry about that.

ChatGPT was used to investigate and dig into topics; this is how I found out about things like the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, Titius-Bode law, Roche Limit and many other subjects which was needed for this project.
